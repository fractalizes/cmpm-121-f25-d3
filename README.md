# CMPM 121 D3 Project

This is my D3 Project for the class CMPM 121 at UC Santa Cruz. This is a game where you walk around your area and collect stacks. Combine stacks with the same color to double it and so on. It is sort of like 2048, but you play it in the real world with your cell phone. Alternatively, you can try it on your computer with directional inputs. Knock yourself out!
